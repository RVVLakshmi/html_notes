<ol>

  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
Unordered List (<ul>): An unordered list is a list of items where each item is preceded by a bullet point or another type of symbol. It's created using the <ul> element.
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Oranges</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
</ul>
Description List (<dl>): A description list is a list of terms and their corresponding descriptions. Each term is represented by a <dt> (term) element, and each description is represented by a <dd> (description) element. It's created using the <dl> element.
